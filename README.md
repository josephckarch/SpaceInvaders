# Space Invaders
### Personal project by Joseph Karch
#### Implements the SFML C++ library to load the window and sprites.
#### Replicates the Space Invaders game with the player's ship at the bottom of the window, and enemy ships spawning from the top. 
#### Enemies get increasingly fast as time goes on in the game.
#### Users can control the ship with the left and right arrow keys, and shoot with the space bar.
